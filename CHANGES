Changes introduced with each version.

1.2.4
-----

* Adjusted imports to be compatible with Python 3. (ibrahimsag)

1.2.3
-----

* Removed handled exception error logging. Cuts down on spam. (ibrahimsag)
* Some assorted PEP8 fixes. (gtaylor)

1.2.2
-----
* Added ``useraction`` parameter to Express Checkout URL generation
* Raise PayPalConfigError on call attempt with None values for configurations

1.2.1
-----
* Added support for RefundTransaction. (cbsmith)
* Migrated from ancient 72.0 API_VERSION to 98.0 API_VERSION. (cbsmith)
* Style guide compliance updates (some pep8 and pyflakes love). (cbsmith)
* Use POST instead of GET for NVP API to avoid GET length limits. (marcbelmont)
* Obscure API credentials in logged error messages. (davidfooks)
* Various PEP8'ification and cleanup. (oczkers)
* BIC: Python 2.5 is no longer officially supported. Time to move on, folks.

1.2.0
-----

* Minimum supported Python version is now 2.6. It may still work with
  Python 2.5, but I am not hugely interested in maintaining support. Pull
  requests are accepted, of course, but breakages in future releases may happen,
  because I won't be testing against 2.5.
* Replacing urllib2 with python-requests. Greatly simplifies things, and
  improves SSL certificate validation.
* Preliminary (potentially rough) Python 3 support.
* SSL certificate validation is now enabled by default. The old behvaior of
  being able to specify a private cert to validate against still remains.
* Tests are now ran via nose. The old test runner is no more. See the README
  in the ``tests`` directory for details.
* Added the ``bm_create_button`` method, which maps to BMCreateButton.
* UniPay should be working again.
* All of the PayPal exceptions now correctly call Exception.__init__. This will
  prevent some edge cases with those using something like Sentry for error
  reporting.
* Improved the settings module logic. Also added validation to make sure
  correct settings are being passed in.

1.1.0
-----

This version addresses compatibility with the newer versions of the PayPal API
by backing off on pre-query validation. PayPal's API error messages are
the safest bet, as bad as they can be at times.

Lots of cleanup, commenting, and creature comforts abound. Backwards-incompatible
changes are prefixed with 'BIC'.

* BIC: Removed the KEY_ERROR setting. Less complexity is better. (gtaylor)
* BIC: The 'token' position argument to do_express_checkout_payment
  is no a keyword arg, for the sake of consistency. (gtaylor)
* Adding lots of logging, which users may attach to for debugging. (gtaylor)
* Removed RESPONSE_KEYERROR. Wasn't being used. (gtaylor)
* Removed DEBUG_LEVEL setting. Use Python logging. (gtaylor)
* Removed some of the error checking on input values, as this
  limits users to the old API versions. We'll have to rely
  on PayPal's error messages being informative. (gtaylor)
* Bumped the default API version protocol to 72.0, up from 53.0. (gtaylor)

1.0.3
-----

* Python 2.5 compatibility. (Manik)

1.0.2
-----

* Documentation updates. (gtaylor)
* We now distribute with a copy of the Apache License. (gtaylor)

1.0.1
-----

* Misc. more specific imports to avoid import errors. (grigouze)
* Fixes to country test suite. (grigouze)
* Added a countries module that has all of the countries PayPal supports. (gtaylor)
